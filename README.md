### User Story
```
AS a user, 
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.
```

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
